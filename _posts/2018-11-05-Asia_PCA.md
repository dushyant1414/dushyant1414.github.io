title: PCA analysis for interest rates
---

The correlated series in yield curves are ideal for the implementation of PCA, and, fortunately, the meaning of the principal components is well established. Generally, the first component corresponds to the level of interest rates, the second is the slope and the third is the curvature. In this entry we apply PCA to *all* tradable rates markets in Asia and identify whether this approach can be used to trade mean reversion to "fundamental" value (based on PCA).

#Methodology: how to decompose the curve into its components
1. De-mean the individual rates in each curve
2. Calculate the covariance matrix of the de-meaned series
3. Perform an eigendecomposition on the covariance matrix
4. The principal components (or **scores**) are the eigenvectors * raw (de-meaned) data
5. And the loading of each **score** for each tenor is given by the eigenvector
6. Hence, to recreate the original series, we multiply the loadings (eigenvectors) by the scores
